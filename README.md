# A51/1 Cipher
This code is an implementation of the A51/1 cipher that doesn't focus on hardware performance.
<br>
<br>
This implementation aims to provide some modifications to the code I found online on this page called [A5/1 Pedagogical Implementation](https://cryptome.org/jya/a51-pi.htm), provided by Marc Briceno, Ian Goldberg, and David Wagner.
